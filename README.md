# RT_SOBEL
Hardware implementation of an edge detection algorithm (Sobel)

-This is a Hardware implementation of the edge detection Algorithm Sobel

-Considering the real time constraints of the problem, implementation was done through a full custom hardware design based on the following article : 

"Hardware Description of Multi-Directional Fast Sobel Edge Detection Processor by VHDL for Implementing on FPGA"
                                                                                Arash Nosrat & Yousef S. Kavian
